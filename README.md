This is my game for the "Loop Implementation" assignment in ATLS 4140.

9/14 - I started by downloading the base of the [finite_state_machine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/2d/finite_state_machine) from the [Godot Demo Projects Repo](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master) (which included using their provided assets). It took me about 30 minutes to set this up.

9/14 – Added mobs that will follow and attack the player – 30 minutes – Followed tutorial:
